# Global Agricultural Trends

This dataset was extracted from the United Nations Statistics Division, built in collaboration with the UN Environment Programme (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/qindicators.cshtml#indicator-7). This is my team's attempt to predict terrestrial protected land areas from other agricultural features. This project also involves Exploratory Data Analysis where we see if (according to the given data) there is any significant difference in agricultural features between Global North & Global south countries.

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborns

Created as part of the Data 144 class @ UC Berkeley
